== Hello World

Lets start with the following Hello World app:

image::images/hw.png[holis]

The code is simply

....
#include "AquaOS.h"

namespace hello_world {
    void startScreen() { <1>
        drawCenteredString("Hello World!");
        toolbarAddHome(); <2>
    }
}
....

All Sketches apps are written using callbacks, that is, functions that are called when certain
functionality has to be performed. The function that is called when a app goes to the 
foreground is `startScreen`.

TIP: Apps are always active. They get called every second to perform it business logic, 
but only one app can be on the foreground at a given time. In other words, only one app 
receives the UI events.
