== Hello World

Lets start with the following Hello World app:

image::hw.png[]

The code is quite simple:

[source,c]
----
#include "AquaOS.h"

namespace hello_world {
    void startScreen() { <1>
        drawCenteredString("Hello World!");
        toolbarAddHome(); <2>
    }
}
----
<1> All Sketches apps are written using callbacks, that is, functions that are called when certain functionality has to be performed. The function that is called when a app goes to the 
foreground is `startScreen`.
<2> This function adds a *home* button in the toolbar, when pressed, the application is no longer on the foreground, and the desktop is shown.

TIP: Apps are always active. They get called every second to perform it business logic, 
but only one app can be on the foreground at a given time. In other words, only one app 
receives the UI events.
