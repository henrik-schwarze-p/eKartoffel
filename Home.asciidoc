== Hello World

All Sketches apps are written using callbacks, that is, functions that are called when certain functionality has 
to be performed. The function that is called when a app goes to the foreground is `startScreen`.

The code for the most simple app, that is, a title, a text and a toolbar is

....
#include "AquaOS.h"

namespace hello_world {
    void startScreen() {
        drawCenteredString("Hello World!");
        toolbarAddHome();
    }
}
....



The first configure will take a while (30 minutes to 2 hours) to clone and build, see <<benchmarking-this-repo>> for more details.
